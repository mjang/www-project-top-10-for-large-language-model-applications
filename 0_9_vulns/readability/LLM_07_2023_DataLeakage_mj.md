Data leakage occurs when an LLM reveals, through its responses:
- Sensitive information
- Proprietary algorithms
- Intellectual property
- Information that violates user privacy
- Other confidential details 

Users of an LLM should know the risks. They should also know to avoid including sensitive data.

The designers of an LLM should include code which:
- Sanitizes input data
- Validates that data is free of private information

The company which hosts the LLM should have appropriate terms and conditions, which describes how data is processed.
