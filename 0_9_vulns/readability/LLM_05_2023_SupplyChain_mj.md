Vulnerabilities in LLM supply chain can affect the integrity of training data,  

Vulnerabilities in ML models, deployment platforms can lead to :

- Biased outcomes
- Security breaches
- Complete system failures

Supply chain vulnerabilities normally focus on software components. The problem can worse in AI due to the use of:

- Transfer learning
= Pre-trained models
- Crowdsourced data

LLMs such as OpenGPT extension plugins are also susceptible to this vulnerability.
